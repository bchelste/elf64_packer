**Linux project**
(written in **C**)


This project is about coding a simple packer.

üì¶

‚ÄúPackers‚Äù - are tools which compress executable programs (.exe, .dll,
.ocx ...) and then encrypting them simultaneously. 
During execution, a program passing through a packer is loaded in memory, compressed and encrypted, then it will be decompressed (decrypted as well) and finally be executed.

The existence of such programs is related to the fact that antivirus programs generally
analyse programs when they are loaded in memory, before they are executed. Thus,
encryption and compression of a packer allow to bypass this behavior by obfuscating the
content of an executable until it execution.

---

The goal of this project is to code a program that will at first encrypt a program given
as parameter. Only 64 bits ELF files will be managed here.

# some useful commands for working with ELF files
- **file** <efl_file>
- **readelf** (-h -> to read header, -a -> to read all) <elf_file>



to compile elf64 => flag **-m64** is required,


there is also flag **-no-pie** for **EXEC** type
(and type = **DYN** without that flag)

# Usage
**make  -> woody-woodpacker**

**woody_woodpacker** <optional_flag **i**> <elf_64_file> -> woody


flag **i** is used for mo detail information about elf file


(woody is a result elf64 file **encrypted** program, it displays "....WOODY....",
followed by a newline, other execution after decryption is not altered ->
execution is identical to the binary given as parametr to **woody-woodpacker**).

make [ all, clean, fclean, re]
and *make hello* to create test ELF64 file
(clang -m64 -o hello ./test_files/hello.c)


**encryption key** is generated randomly from */dev/urandom*
it will be displayed on the standart output when running the main program
